# SQL-EXAMPLE

This file contains an example of the SQL-based programming code that I once implemented to have a user database on an app that was in its beta stages. The code created a simple database of usernames that was then converted into an array of views. The purpose of this database was to keep a record of tips for each user for summary and performance reasons. The implementation was scrapped when I came to a realization that recording records in this regard didnâ€™t actually provide any benefit to the team.
Thank you for looking it over.
